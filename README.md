# Jailbreak themes on a non jailbroken iPhone (Windows Repo Tool)
*Windows Repo Tool Method*

*This only works for the icons of the theme you want*

Requirements

iPhone/ iPad
Windows PC / Laptop
A way to send .deb files to your iPhone/iPad (I use send anywhere)

Download

1. First go to https://github.com/SarahH12099/Windows-Repo-Tool on your windows device
2. Then download the latest version of the repo tool at the releases tab
3. Extract the zip file and open the folder
4. Go to your Downloads folder
3. Now click the WindowsRepoTool.exe

How to use the Windows Repo Tool

1. To add a repo click on the text box on the left hand side and type or paste in the repo you want to add then press the add repo button
2. To open a repo click on the repo you want to open then press the open selected repo button
3. Now find the theme you want to download (You can also use this to download tweak .deb files)
4. Once the theme is downloaded go back to the folder where the WindowsRepoTool.exe is located
5. There should be a new folder called "Debs"
6. Click on the "Debs" folder and there should be the .deb file of the theme you downloaded

How to use the theme on your iDevice

1. Extract the .deb file using Unzip by pressing the share icon and tapping the unzip app in the share sheet
2. Click on the extracted folder
3. Extract data.tar.gz (If this is not there you cant use the theme)
4. Now tap on the new data folder
5. Go to library then themes
6. Then go to icon bundles (If this is not there search the different folders until you find the icons

How to set the icons using shortcuts

1. Make a shortcut
2. Name it whatever app you want to theme
3. Add an open app action with the app you want to theme
4. Go to the 3 lines and add to home screen
5. Choose the icon
6. You may remove the label if you want
7. Press add and repeat!

**Remove banner:**
1. Make an automation for open app
2. Choose all the apps you themed
3. Add a text action and type whatever (you can really choose whatever action that does nothing idk i just use text)
4. Press next and turn off ask before running
5. Press a couple icons on the home screens and you should see regular notifications, and no banner

**Now to disable the notifications:**
1. Go into settings -> screen time
2. See all activity
3. Scroll down to notifications and hit shortcuts - If you canâ€™t press it, tap one of the other days, then go back
4. Turn off notifications
5. You will have to repeat the remove notifications every day or every respring^^
